## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Five💪🏾

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is?

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Write a function named calculateSupply
2. The function takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
3. calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the old age of X"
4. Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

Good Luck 😀

###### Example

If i pass the age 52 and amount per day 2 the the function `calculateSupply` the function should return or console log _'You will need 104 to last you until the old age of 52'_
