## Javascript Fundementals Challenge💪🏾

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

##### Your Task 😃:

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

1. takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
2. calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
3. outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your dog is NN years old in dog years!"
4. Call the function twice with different sets of values and see which dog is older.

Good Luck 😀

###### Example

If i pass 12 to calculateDogAge function then the function should console _`Your dog is 84 years old in dog years!`_
