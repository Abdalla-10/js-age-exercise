## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Three (Part Two)💪🏾

Aisha is still building her tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is
20%.

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Write a function `calcTip` that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above. Use the function type you like the most.

###### Example

If i pass the value 275 the the function `calcTip` the function should return or console log _'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'_

Good Luck 😀

## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Five💪🏾

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is?

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Write a function named calculateSupply
2. The function takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
3. calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the old age of X"
4. Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

Good Luck 😀

###### Example

If i pass the age 52 and amount per day 2 the the function `calculateSupply` the function should return or console log _'You will need 104 to last you until the old age of 52'_
